*This is a very poor attempt at the task ..*

My GO is quite rusty, having been focussed on JavaScript and Typescript for about the last 19 months
I had never used protocol buffers - not sure they are the right choice here, there was a lot to learn and issues to work through with the compiler and module structure - the principles were familiar from Entity Framework 
I haven't used Docker, or Kubernetes.. so there was some time spent on research there - but I have made no attempt to use either here.
Again... not entirely clear if you wanted a client and server in GO, or maybe a JS client - I went for go
I spent about 8 hours in all - probably 6 of them were wrestling the toolchain, and learning go modules (which I seemed to make a massive meal of)

It's a perfectly reasonable task, and someone familiar with all of the tools and approaches and having a working toolset could (I am sure) complete it with time to spare.

That person is not me ... yet

Happy to talk, if you think it worthwhile

Nick
